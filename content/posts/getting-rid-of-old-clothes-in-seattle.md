In the past two years, we've moved twice. The first time we moved, we packed a bag of clothes intended for recycling and/or donation. Then, we got lazy and simply brought that bag with us while moving. The second time we moved, we brought the bag, still packed, without a second thought.

7 months after settling into our new home, we decided enough was enough. We were going to get rid of all of the clothing and shoes we weren't wearing anymore!

The problem - and a big reason why we procrastinated for so long - is that finding a place that isn't going to just resell[^0] (or worse, ship overseas[^1]) your clothing is not so easy! King County's [Threadcycle](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/dnrp/solid-waste/programs/ecoconsumer/threadcycle.aspx) program has a [list of sites and programs](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/dnrp/solid-waste/programs/ecoconsumer/threadcycle/threadcycle-locations.aspx) that will accept used clothing, but every partner on the list either resells and/or ships abroad. Heck, some of the organizations are even for-profit (e.g. Value Village)!

<!--- Footnotes -->
[^0]: I suppose there's nothing strictly wrong with clothing being sold in thrift stores where the proceeds fund charity, but that feels worse than giving it away directly.

[^1]: Used clothing sent abroad, ostensibly to support local sellers and provide affordable clothing, can actually [negatively impact local clothing industries](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-28839-5_108#Sec3) or [end up in landfills anyway](https://gizmodo.com/clothing-pile-chile-atacama-desert-satellite-image-1850443019).
